<!-- (1): In VS Code, we can use a VS code built-in tool called Emmet, which displays an abbreviation for suggested documentation. We can quickly create the structure of our HTML file by typing 'html:5' into the first line and Emmet suggests the HTML format for us. This is the first thing we've done in this project; we successfully created our HTML file. -->
