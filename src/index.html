<!-- (1): In VS Code, we can use a VS code built-in tool called Emmet, which displays an abbreviation for suggested documentation. We can quickly create the structure of our HTML file by typing 'html:5' into the first line and Emmet suggests the HTML format for us. This is the first thing we've done in this project; we successfully created our HTML file. -->

    <!-- (2): changed the title of our document from 'Document' to the title of the prject -->
    <title>Adopt Me! v8</title>
    <!-- (5): added a link tag within our 'head' tag to bring in our CSS styling into our file. The 'ref' attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document. See CSS file in src folder. -->

    <!-- (3): created a div tag inside our 'body' tags.  -->
    <div id ="root">not rendered</div>
    <!-- (4): following the div tags, we've included two script tags (the src attribute followed by the link is specifying the URL of an external script file. All scripts from the specfied files will be loaded into our HTML page). In the links, you'll see that we're grabbing the React API part of the library followed by the React DOM, which renders everything to the DOM -->
